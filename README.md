# bing pre prompts

Extention that adds a list of pre prompts to the bing chat.
## Features

- Adds a list of pre prompts to the bing chat.
- You can add your own pre prompts to the list.

## How does it work?

When you o to the bing chat, you will see a list of pre prompts at the right side. When you click on one of them, it will be added to the chat.
If you want to add a pre prompt to the list, you can do that by clicking on the button "Add pre prompt" at the bottom of the list. 

If you want to edit a pre prompt, you currently need to do it manualy in the local storage. You can do that by pressing F12 and going to the tab "Application". There you can find the local storage and edit the pre prompts in the "promptsList" key.


## Future plans

### Near future

### Far future
